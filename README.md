 Parametric sheel generator for 3d printing

Hello ! I'm Maxime, a young product designer. I coded this little software to generate shells that i 3D print. 
I'm sorry as i'm not a dev, this may be a little bit raw.

This is part of a larger project, that aim to build open source home products. I wish to counter planned obsolescence
by designing products that you can build, repair and dimantle only with your hands : no glue, no screws etc.

The website is under creation, and i'll add the link really soon ! 

You can use my code for whatever you want, and i'll love to se what you'll make out of it.
