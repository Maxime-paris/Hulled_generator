 Parametric sheel generator for 3d printing

Hello ! I'm Maxime, a young product designer. I coded this little software to generate shells that i 3D print. 
I'm sorry as i'm not a dev, this may be a little bit raw.

This is part of a larger project, that aim to build open source home products. I wish to counter planned obsolescence
by designing products that you can build, repair and dismantle only with your hands : no glue, no screws etc.

You can see some examples in the example folder.
The website is under creation, and i'll add the link really soon ! 

You can use my code for whatever you want. On my free time, i'll try to add a menu to choose in a librairy of many parametric shapes.

Also, the thicness of the shell i printed were add with a 3d modeling software, i couldnt figure out how to code a thikness, feel free to try !
